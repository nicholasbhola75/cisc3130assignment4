# Assignment 4: Movie Genres

The objective of this assigment was to work with HashMaps in order to store information about Movie Genres extracted from a csv file, then print a report detailing how many movies fell under that genre and released during specific years

Problem Description
There is a business owner who wants to know which movie genres are available out there, in order to know which categories of movies to have at his online storefront. In order to do so he needs to know more about movies produced and has a copy of data from the MovieLens project.

The data comes from MovieLens https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ - any of the data samples would be fine however for the purposes of prototyping it would make the most sense to use the latest dataset (small, 1MB zip file) found at this permalink https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest
